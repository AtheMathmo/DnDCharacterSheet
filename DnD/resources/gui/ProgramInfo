DnD Digital Character Sheet v0.1.

You can Save and Load characters using the toolbar buttons.
Import is currently not implemented, will allow use with another tool I like (tcaraways char creator).

You can right click on the text labels next to
character attributes, skills or saving throws to perform a roll for this field.

Finally please report any bugs to this page:
